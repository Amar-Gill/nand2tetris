Homework assignments and development tools used in the completion of the course: "From Nand to Tetris - Building a Modern Computer from First Principles".

In part one of the course students build increasingly complex computer chips beginning with only a Nand gate. The chips are assembled to build a general purpose 16 bit computer than can run programs written in the Hack Machine Language. The final project was to write an assembler program to translate Hack Assembly Language programs into Hack Machine Code that can run on the computer.

Completed May 2020 via Coursera.
